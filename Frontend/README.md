User Profile Form â€” plain-JS (jQuery) primary

I converted a React/Vite app into a plain HTML + jQuery version located in `plain-js/` and added a simple start script.

Quick start (PowerShell):

1) Serve with the included npm script (uses npx http-server):

```powershell
# from project root
npm run start
# open http://localhost:5173 in your browser
Start-Process http://localhost:5173
```

2) Or open static file directly (no server):

```powershell
Start-Process .\plain-js\index.html
```

Notes:
- I kept all original React/Vite sources under `src/` and the original `package.json` dependencies were replaced with a minimal package.json that serves `plain-js/` using `http-server` so you can run the app without installing/building React.
- If you want me to permanently remove React sources and clean up the repo, tell me and I will remove them after creating a backup commit.
